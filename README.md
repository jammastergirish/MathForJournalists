# MathForJournalists

This app is an idea that's been simmering for a few years but I've never bothered to actually code it. I'm finally putting it together as the final project in Harvard's superb CS50 course.

While I've been coding for more than two decades, I wanted to fill some gaps in my knowledge — primarily on algorithms and data structures — and found David Malan to be a wonderful teacher. 

I chose an iOS app as a final project in order to get a handle on SwiftUI, Apple's new user interface builder. I also wanted something I could put together relatively quickly given that this wasn't the main purpose of me taking the course.

It's nothing complicated—essentially a basic calculator with a few different equations that I saw journalists struggle with over the years.

- Percentage change

- Currency change

- Inflation rates

Going forward, I'd want to style it better, add some more nifty experiences such as the slider, add more text examples.
